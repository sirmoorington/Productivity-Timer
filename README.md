# Productivity Timer

A simple app that tracks your productive work sessions and rewards you with free time.  

---

##  How it works
- **Start Button** – begin a productive session (e.g., studying, working)  
- **Stop Button** – end the session  
- The app calculates how long you were productive  
- 25% of that time is added to your **free time balance**  
  - Example: 1 hour productive work = 15 minutes free time  

There is also a **Free Time Mode**:  
- **Start Free Time** – use your earned free time  
- **Stop Free Time** – end it early (unused minutes stay in your free time balance)

## Example
- Work for **60 minutes** → Earn **15 minutes free time**  
- Take a break of **10 minutes** → You still have **5 minutes free time** left
